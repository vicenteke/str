In order to execute the code, just run:

	$ make

It will probably ask you to enter your sudo password, so the program is allowed to change scheduler options.
This command will run with the following parameters:

	Period: 500
    Priority: 5
    Load: 100000
    Scheduler: SCHED_RR
    
To run with SCHED_FIFO, just execute:

	$ make fifo
	
And to run with a lower priority, use:

	$ make rr
	
Of course, you can use differente settings. To do so, run 'make' once, then you can execute it with:

	$ taskset -c 'core' ./s 'period in ms' 'priority' 'load' 'scheduler'
	
where scheduler is either 'SCHED_FIFO' or 'SCHED_RR'. An example running default parameters is:

	$ taskset -c 0 ./s 500 5 100000 SCHED_RR

If you don't want to restricting it to any processor:

	$ ./s 500 5 100000 SCHED_RR
